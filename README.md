== Snap Library

The Snap library is designed to "snap" on to any php code and provide
the ability to stuff meta data into document comments for php classes.

It also provides a simple Class Loader as well as some goodies for
Wordpress, which should probably be made a bit more abstract for use
in any library, but I just don't have the time for that right now.
